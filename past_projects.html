<h3>A Clustering Approach to the Bounded Diameter Minimum Spanning Tree Problem Using Ants</h3>

<b>Master's Advisor:</b> <br /><a href="https://turing.cs.hbg.psu.edu/~bui/">Dr. Thang N. Bui</a> at
Penn State Harrisburg <br />
<b>Abstract:</b><br />
The bounded diameter minimum spanning tree problem is the problem of
finding a minimum cost spanning tree of a graph such that the number
of edges along the longest path in the tree is at most d. This problem
is well known to be NP-hard. We present an ant-based algorithm for
this problem in which we use two species of ants. The first species is
used to discover clusters in the vertex set and then a bounded
diameter spanning tree (BDST) is created within each cluster. The
second species is then used to connect the cluster BDSTs together
building a bounded diameter spanning tree for the whole graph. This
tree is then locally optimized yielding a solution to the overall
problem. Experimental tests have been conducted on two types of
complete graphs, 135 Euclidean and 120 non-Euclidean, totalling 255
graphs. Each Euclidean graph consists of a set of vertices randomly
placed in the unit square and the edge cost between two vertices is
the Euclidean distance between them. The non-Euclidean graphs are
structured such that all of the edge weights in the graph have been
randomly selected from <a href="0.01,0.99">0.01,0.99</a>. For the Euclidean graphs the
results show that our algorithm achieves solutions close to the best
known for most of the instances. However, on the non-Euclidean graphs
our algorithm has obtained new best known solutions for the majority
of the graphs and has come very close to the best known in the
others.</p>
