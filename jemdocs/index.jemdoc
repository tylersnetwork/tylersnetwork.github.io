== Short Bio
Tyler Derr is an assistant professor in computer science at
Vanderbilt University since Fall 2020. His research lies in social computing, data
mining, and machine learning, especially in social network analysis,
deep learning on graphs, and data science for social good with
applications in education, health, political science, and autism research. He received his
PhD (2020) in Computer Science from Michigan State University under
the supervision of [http://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili Dr. Jiliang Tang]
and was a member of the Data Science and Engineering (DSE) Lab and Teachers in Social Media (TISM) Project. He had completed his MS
(2015) in Computer Science at The Pennsylvania State University and
dual BS (2013) in Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences at The
Pennsylvania State University. He was the recipient of the Best Reviewer Award at
ICWSM 2019 & 2021, the Best Student Poster Award at SDM 2019, the "People's
Choice" Award for the 3 Minute Thesis Competition at MSU, and the Fall 2020 Teaching Innovation Award from the School of Engineering at Vanderbilt. Tyler also actively serves as
a reviewer\/program committee member for journals/conferences in his
research domain.\n
