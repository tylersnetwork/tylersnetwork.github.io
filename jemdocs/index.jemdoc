Dr. Tyler Derr is an Assistant Professor in the [https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/cs/ Department of Computer Science], Teaching and Affiliate Faculty in the [https://www.vanderbilt.edu/datascience/ Data Science Institute], and Faculty Fellow in the [https://www.vanderbilt.edu/autismandinnovation/ Frist Center for Autism and Innovation] at [https://www.vanderbilt.edu/ Vanderbilt University]. Before that, he received his PhD in Computer Science from Michigan State University in 2020 under the supervision of [http://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili Dr. Jiliang Tang]. He has published 50+ papers in highly ranked journals and top conference proceedings, with h-index 30 and i10-index 55 ([https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=et6IhFcAAAAJ Google Scholar]).

Tyler directs the [http://my.vanderbilt.edu/nds Network and Data Science (NDS)] lab, which conducts research in the areas of data mining and machine learning, with emphasis on social network analysis, deep learning on graphs, and data science for social good with applications in drug discovery, education, political science, and neurodiversity. He has mentored his Ph.D. students to receive numerous honors and awards, including Vanderbilt’s C. F.
