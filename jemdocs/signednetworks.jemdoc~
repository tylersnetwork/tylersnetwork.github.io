= CAREER: Harnessing the Positive Power of Negative Links for Network Analytics

== Project Description
ject will play an integral role in introducing existing network analytics to students through developed undergraduate and graduate courses, while also providing first-hand research experiences through semester projects. Additionally, this project will support the mentorship of underrepresented groups through various university programs, including first-generation and neurodiverse students to leverage their unique strengths and to promote diversity in our next generation of scientists and engineers.

This project is focused on the advancement of methods, theories, models, and measurements, for networks with negative links, known as, signed networks. The project will provide dedicated efforts towards deeper analysis and better predictions on networks with negative links while spanning the four main pillars of network analytics. Specifically, novel network theories are proposed and built upon the complex positive/negative link interactions, dedicated signed graph neural networks will be developed for overcoming existing challenges in prior models, improved signed network modeling towards better synthetic generation and evaluation, and finally robust signed network measurements. The project is motivated by unprecedented opportunities to harness the additive power of negative links to improve network analytics, but also in solving the research challenges associated with mining and learning on signed networks. Each of the proposed research directions is positioned to advance network analytics through investigating original unexplored problems and developing novel theories and methodologies.
