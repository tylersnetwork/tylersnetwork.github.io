<h2>Short Bio</h2>
<p>Dr. Tyler Derr is an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/cs/">Department of Computer Science</a>, Teaching and Affiliate Faculty in the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/datascience/">Data Science Institute</a>, and Faculty Fellow in the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/autismandinnovation/">Frist Center for Autism and Innovation</a> at <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/">Vanderbilt University</a>. He received his PhD in Computer Science from Michigan State University in 2020 under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili">Dr. Jiliang Tang</a> and was a member of the Data Science and Engineering (DSE) Lab and Teachers in Social Media (TISM) Project. He had complete his MS in Computer Science at The Pennsylvania State University in 2015 and dual BS in Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences at The Pennsylvania State University in 2013.</p>
<p>Tyler directs the <a href="http://my.vanderbilt.edu/nds">Network and Data Science (NDS)</a> lab, which conducts research in the areas of data mining and machine learning, with emphasis on social network analysis, deep learning on graphs, and data science for social good with applications in drug discovery, education, political science, and autism research. His PhD students received Vanderbilt's C. F. Chen Best Paper Award in Computer Science in 2022 and Runner-Up Award in 2023. He is actively involved in top conferences in his field, both in terms of publishing and serving as an SPC/PC member, while receiving recognition such as the Best Student Poster Award at SDM&rsquo;19 and Best Reviewer Awards at ICWSM&rsquo;19 and &rsquo;21, as well as WSDM&rsquo;22. He has contributed to the organization of international conferences, including serving as the Publicity Co-Chair of KDD&rsquo;22 and &rsquo;23, Doctoral Consortium Co-Chair of WSDM&rsquo;22, and Proceedings Co-Chair of KDD&rsquo;21. Being passionate about sharing knowledge, he has co-organized multiple workshops including Machine Learning on Graphs (MLoG) Workshop at WSDM’22 and ’23 along with at ICDM’22 and ’23; he has delivered tutorials on Graph Neural Networks at KDD’20 and AAAI’21. He serves as Associate Editor for Elsevier Big Data Research and Topic Editor in Frontiers in Big Data. Additionally, he was honored with the Fall 2020 <a href="https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/news/2021/five-engineering-faculty-recognized-with-innovative-teaching-awards/">Teaching Innovation Award</a> from the School of Engineering at Vanderbilt University, highlighting his dedication to exceptional teaching. Tyler received the prestigious <a href="https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/news/2023/vanderbilt-researcher-wins-nsf-career-award-to-close-a-gap-in-network-analysis-by-better-modeling-negative-online-interactions-like-unfollowing-and-blocking/">NSF CAREER Award</a> in 2023. </p>
